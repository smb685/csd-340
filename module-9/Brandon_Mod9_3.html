    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>Once upon a time, four travelers set out on an <span id="word1">_________</span>. 
       The road was long, and the journey tested their courage at every turn.</p>

    <p>As they reached the mountain ridge, they watched the <span id="word2">_________</span> 
       paint the sky in shades of red and gold. It was a sight they would never forget.</p>

    <p>Each challenge they faced carried a <span id="word3">_________</span> 
       that made them stronger. But above all, it was their <span id="word4">_________</span> 
       that kept them moving forward together.</p>

    <!-- Buttons to reveal each word -->
    <p>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('word1').innerHTML = wordOne">Reveal Word 1</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('word2').innerHTML = wordTwo">Reveal Word 2</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('word3').innerHTML = wordThree">Reveal Word 3</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('word4').innerHTML = wordFour">Reveal Word 4</button>
    </p>
